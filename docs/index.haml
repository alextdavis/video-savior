    %h2 About
    %p 
      Video Savior is a Mac application which makes it easy to download videos from
      popular video sharing sites. Video Savior is a graphical facade for the 
      %a(href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/") youtube-dl
      command-line program. This application wouldn't be possible without
      the hard work of youtube-dl's contributors, so consider making a 
      %a(href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/donations.html") donation
      to the youtube-dl project. 
    %p
      Video Savior is designed to be minimally intrusive to the normal functioning
      of youtube-dl. When you press download, Video Savior will open a Terminal 
      window, where the command-line program will run. This also allows the user
      to see the download progress. 
    
    %p
      For now, Video Savior is in alpha. This means the software is likely unstable,
      and I'm looking for all the feedback I can get. If you have bug reports, 
      suggestions for the application, or suggestions for the documentation,
      please send me an email at video-savior@alextdavis.me. 
    
    %h3 Download
    %p 
      For now, I'm only distributing Video Savior directly to alpha-testers. If
      you'd like to request a copy, send me an email at 
      video-savior@alextdavis.me.

    %h3 System Requirements
    %ul
      %li macOS 10.10 Yosemite or later
      %li Administrator privileges for installation (<a href="#admin">more info</a>)

    %h2 Help
    %h3#components First-time Setup 
    %p 
      When Video Savior first launches, it will try to install the internal
      components that are required for Video Savior to function. When you click 
      "Continue", Video Savior will open a Terminal window which will install:
    %ul 
      %li
        %a(href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/") Xcode command line tools,
        a set of essential programs for doing command-line work on the Mac, 
        published by Apple as part of Xcode, the software which one uses 
        to write software for Apple products. Homebrew won't work without
        the Xcode command line tools. 
      %li 
        %a(href="https://brew.sh") Homebrew,
        a Package Manager widely used to manage the installation and updating 
        of command-line software on the Mac. This is used to install youtube-dl
        and ffmpeg (below), and keep them up to date. 
      %li
        %a(href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/") youtube-dl,
        the command-line program which Video Savior uses to download videos.
      %li
        %a(href="https://ffmpeg.org") FFmpeg,
        a program which handles conversion of files from the formats that 
        video sites use to those your computer can read easily. 
    %p 
      Because these command line tools modify the system, the first-time setup
      must be run by a user with administrator privileges.

    %p
      The first time components are installed, you'll have to type your 
      system password into the Terminal window. First, a list of the 
      exact changes which will be made will be displayed, and you'll
      be asked to "Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort". Once
      you press return, you'll see a prompt of "Password: " followed by a key
      shape (

      ). As you type, your password will be hidden. Once you've typed your 
      password, press return. The installation should only take a few minutes. 
    
    %h3 Options
    %dl
      %dt Video URL
      %dd The URL of the video to be downloaded. 

      %dt Format
      %dd 
        This will select which kind of video file will be downloaded.
        %dl
          %dt Default
          %dd 
            This setting will prefer MPEG, but will use WebM where there is a
            higher resolution video available in WebM only. This setting will
            also fallback gracefully for unusual video sources. 
          
          %dt MPEG
          %dd 
            The Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) develops the industry 
            standard video formats. If you want to be sure you can play
            back the videos you download without 3rd party software, you'd be
            best off choosing MPEG format. 

          %dt WebM 
          %dd 
            WebM is an open format developed primarily by Google. Thus, YouTube
            videos are only available at 1440p60 or 4K resolution in the WebM
            format. WebM is widely adopted, but not industry standard, and thus,
            for example, cannot be played back in QuickTime or on iPhone. WebM 
            videos can be played back with 
            %a(href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/") VLC Media Player.

          %dt Audio Only
          %dd
            This will download an audio track alone, if available. It will prefer
            a file with an .m4a extension if available. 

          %dt Legacy
          %dd 
            This format will only download single-file videos (rather than
            separate audio and video files.) This may be useful, for example, 
            to get a video from YouTube in 3gp format. 
      
      %dt Max Quality
      %dd This allows you to limit the resolution of the video download. 

      %dt Use high framerate video when available 
      %dd 
        When set, Video Savior will allow download of video with framerates above
        40 frames per second. 

      %dt Download to
      %dd 
        The folder where downloaded files should be placed. Press the "Change"
        button to change this folder. 
      
      %dt Update Components
      %dd 
        This will check for new versions of the internal components. If a video
        fails to download, it may be because the internal components are out of
        date. 

      %dt Set as Defaults
      %dd 
        This will save your current Format, Max Quality, high framerate, and 
        Download folder settings so they'll be selected next time you open
        Video Savior. 

      %dt Download
      %dd Download the video. 

    %h3#help FAQ
    %dl
      %dt The video didn't download. What do I do?
      %dd
        Try pressing "Update Components", and try again. Some video sites change
        frequently, and the internal components may need to be updated to adapt. 
        If the problem persists, try reading the text in the Terminal window to
        look for errors. If you don't see an error you understand, I can try to
        help. Copy & paste the entire contents of the
        Terminal window into an email, and send it to video-savior@alextdavis.me
        with "download error" in the subject. I'll try to work with you to 
        solve or at least explain the problem. 
        As I start getting error reports, I'll update this FAQ with the 
        solutions to common problems. 

      %dt#brew There was an error in the Terminal window when I tried to update components. What do I do?
      %dd
        Send me an email with the error. Copy & paste the entire contents of the
        Terminal window into an email, and send it to video-savior@alextdavis.me
        with "component error" in the subject. I'll try to work with you to 
        solve or at least explain the problem. 
        As I start getting error reports, I'll update this FAQ with the 
        solutions to common problems. 

      %dt The app crashed! What do I do?
      %dd 
        Oops! Sorry about that. When the error reporter window (which says 
        "Video Savior quit unexpectedly") comes up, click "Report...", then
        "Show Details", and copy & paste the text that appears into an email, and 
        send it to video-savior@alextdavis.me with "crash" in the subject. 
        I'll try to figure out what happened, and hopefully your crash report
        will help make future versions of Video Savior more stable. 

      %dt#admin Do I need to have administrator permissions to use Video Savior?
      %dd 
        Yes and no. 
        The internal component Homebrew, which is used to install the other
        internal components, requires administrator privileges to be 
        installed. Once the internal components have been installed, however,
        Video Savior should work fine on all user accounts. So if you don't have
        administrator permissions, ask an admin to run Video Savior on their
        account, get it working, and then it should also work on your account.
